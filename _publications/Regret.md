In this paper, we consider learning and control problem in an unknown Markov jump linear system (MJLS) with perfect state observations. We first establish a generic upper bound on regret for any learning based algorithm. We then propose a certainty equivalence-based learning alagrithm and show that this algorithm achieves a regret of O(\sqrt(T)\log(T)) relative to a certain subset of the sample space. As part of our analysis, we revisit the switched least squares system identification algorithm of [1], [2] for autonomous MJLS and generalize it to controlled MJLS, establishing strong consistency and almost sure rates of convergence of this method.
