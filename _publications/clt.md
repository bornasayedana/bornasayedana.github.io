The central limit theorem is a fundamental result
in probability theory that characterizes the distribution of
deviation from the mean in the law of large numbers. Similar
distributional behavior emerges in other frameworks such as
maximum likelihood estimation, least squares estimation, and
stochastic approximation. In this paper, we establish a central
limit theorem for the cumulative per-step cost incurred by
the optimal policy in linear quadratic regulators using first
principles. Our proof technique relies on a decomposition
of cumulative cost using a completion of square argument,
properties of the noise sequence with even density, and a central
limit theorem for martingale difference sequences. <a href="https://bornasayedana.github.io/public-files/public-files/CDC24.pdf" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">(pdf)</a>
