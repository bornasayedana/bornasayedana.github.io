About Me
======
I am a final year PhD candidate at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at McGill University under the supervision of <span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">Prof. Aditya Mahajan</span>](https://adityam.github.io/) and <span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">Prof. Peter Caines</span>](https://www.mcgill.ca/cim/caines). I am working at Center for Intelligent Machines (CIM), and I am affiliated with Montreal Institute of Learning and Algorithms (MILA) and Group for Research in Decision Analysis (GERAD). I received my Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from McGill University. My research interest lies at intersection of reinforcement learning, mathematical statistics, and control theory. My goal is to design algorithms for autonomous control systems with analytical performance guarantees.
